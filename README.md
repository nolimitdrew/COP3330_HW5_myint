# COP3330_HW5_myint
Your task will be to create a class, called MyInt, which will allow storage of any non-negative integer (theoretically without an upper limit -- although there naturally is an eventual limit to storage in a program). You will also provide some operator overloads, so that objects of type MyInt will act like regular integers, to some extent (To make them act completely like regular integers, it would take overloading most of the operators available, which we will not do here). There are many ways to go about creating such a class, but all will require dynamic allocation (since variables of this type should not have a limit on their capacity).
